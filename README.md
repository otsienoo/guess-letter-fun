The code is a simple implementation of a Hangman game where the player guesses letters of a hidden word. In this version, the words are names of African countries. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

Welcome Message: The game starts by printing a welcome message and hinting that the words are African country names.
Name Input: The player is asked for their name, which is then used in a personalized greeting.
Random Word Selection: A random word is chosen from a predefined list of African countries.

Game Loop:
The game displays underscores for each letter of the chosen word and updates these underscores as the player guesses correctly.
The player has a set number of turns (12 in this case) to guess the letters.
If the player guesses a letter correctly, it's revealed in place of the underscores.
If the player runs out of turns without guessing the word, they lose.

Game Over: After the game ends (either win or lose), the player is asked if they want to play again.

Key Features:
Word List: Contains names of African countries.
Turn Management: Tracks the number of incorrect guesses and provides feedback.

Replay Option: Allows the player to restart the game if desired.
Feel free to modify the list of words or adjust the number of turns to enhance the game!K
